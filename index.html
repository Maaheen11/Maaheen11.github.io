    <section id="projects">
      <h2>Project Portfolio</h2>
            <h3>Building Damage Assessment Using Satellite Imagery for Large Natural Disasters</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Team Member</p>
            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, Computer Vision, Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM2), Edge Aware Loss</p>
            <p>Trained and optimized the DAHiTrA model for post-disaster building damage assessment using satellite imagery, effectively addressing existing challenges such as domain generalization, merging densely packed buildings in urban regions, and underrepresenting smaller structures in damage assessments. Improved segmentation accuracy by integrating Edge Aware Loss (F1-score: 0.903, IoU: 0.834) and implemented a SAM2-based boundary refinement pipeline to enhance building separation in dense urban areas, enabling more precise damage mapping for disaster response. This project demonstrated the real-world impact of AI in disaster response and recovery.</p>

            <h3>Scalable Microservices-Based Weather Notification System</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Team Member</p>

            <p>Designed and implemented a scalable weather notification system using microservices architecture, with each service containerized in Docker and deployed across Cloud Run, Google Kubernetes Engine, and Compute Engine. Leveraged Google Cloud Monitoring to benchmark performance, analyze resource utilization, and explored trade-offs across serverless, containerized, and VM-based environments.</p>
    
            <h3>Image Generation With Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)</h3>
            <p><strong>Graduate Coursework</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, Diffusion Models, U-Net, Deep Learning</p>
            <p>Implemented a DDPM using PyTorch  based on the original paper Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models by Ho et al, designing both forward and reverse diffusion processes and a custom time-conditioned U-Net. Successfully trained on the AFHQ dataset, achieving an FID of 24.43 and demonstrating stable convergence with limited computing resources.</p>

            <h3>An-Automated COVID-19 SOPs Monitoring and Management System</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Team Lead</p>
            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, CNN, MobileNetv2, YOLO, MediaPipe Library, Embedded Systems, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, NVIDIA Jetson Nano microprocessor, Arduino Uno, IoT Sensors (InfraRed Thermal Sensor, SpO2 sensor, Sonar sensor)</p>
            <p>Spearheaded the development of a fully automated COVID-19 SOPs compliance system, integrating computer vision and IoT sensors to automate mask detection, social distancing, and vital sign monitoring. Deployed CNN for face mask detection and MobileNetV2 for social distancing monitoring on NVIDIA Jetson Nano and achieved 90.1% accuracy for real-time compliance monitoring. The project was recognized among the top 4 of 28 capstone submissions and showcased at SOFTEC 2022, NUCES' premier tech competition.</p>

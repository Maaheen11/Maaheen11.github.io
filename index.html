          <p>Hi, I'm Maaheen Yasin, a passionate data scientist and software engineer with a drive to create real-world impact through technology. Currently pursuing my Master's in Professional Computer Science with a major in Visual Computing at Simon Fraser University, I specialize in machine learning, deep learning, and scalable cloud solutions. My journey has taken me from academic projects in computer vision and cloud native technologies to professional experience modernizing data infrastructure at a global fintech company.</p>
          <p>I thrive on solving complex problems, whether it's building intelligent systems for disaster recovery, designing microservices for the cloud, or leading teams to deliver innovative solutions. My toolkit includes Python, PyTorch, SQL, Apache Kafka, Docker, and Google Cloud Platform, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and collaborate with others who share my enthusiasm for making a difference.</p>
          <p>I'm driven by a relentless curiosity and a passion for turning ideas into reality. Whether it's collaborating with diverse teams, exploring cutting-edge technologies, or tackling complex challenges, I thrive on pushing boundaries and creating solutions that inspire and empower!</p>
